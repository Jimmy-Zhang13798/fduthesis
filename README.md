# Fudan Thesis Template (See Chinese below)

To improve the success rate of blind reviews, our school has strengthened format checks in 2024.

As a result, we have compiled this most refined version to date.

[Modified based on Xiangdong Zeng’s fduthesis](https://github.com/stone-zeng/fduthesis)

This adjusted version of fduthesis currently supports English theses only.

This template is not limited to students from the School of Information Science and Engineering. We've made numerous adjustments based on detailed requirements. Fudan students who need to write in English—especially in science and engineering fields—are encouraged to try it.

Note: We are not experts in LaTeX system coding, so the formatting code may not be very tidy—but it works fine.

## Usage

You can preview the sample PDF of the template first.

# 复旦英文论文模板

为了提高盲审通过率，24年对格式审核力度加强。

最终我们整理出这个目前最精细的版本。


[基于Xiangdong Zeng的fduthesis修改](https://github.com/stone-zeng/fduthesis)


本fduthesis调整版目前只适用于英文版；

本模板不仅适用于信院，我们基于很多细节要求进行了调整，需要英文写作的复旦学子，尤其理工科，可尝试使用。

我们并非擅长系统编写latex，格式代码不太整洁，不影响使用。
